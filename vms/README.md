# vms

A Flutter project on vendor management project.

## Getting Started

This project is my first android app project. This application is used to make connection between vendors and users in proper and more easily as retailers can see vendors profile and see different products of vendors. This vendor management system is very necessary to ensure safety and security of the users. Most of the vendor management systems are still running manual system in its process. We have analyzed and wanted to implement a mobile application so that risk management can be done to vendors. This project focuses on managing contracts efficiently and reliable mobile application.   

You can find codes in the vms folder and images that i used in the images folder. 
I have used tools like cloud firestore for database which basically stores data in the document format. It is nosql.
